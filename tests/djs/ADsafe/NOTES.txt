ADsafety:
====================================================

Properties:
  1 widgets cannot load new code at runtime
  2 widgets cannot affect the DOM (outside their designated subtree)
  3 widgets cannot obtain direct references to the DOM
  4 widgets on the same page cannot communicate

- Blacklist field names:
  * "__proto__"
  * "__nodes__", "__star__": private fields

- Proto: there are several safe prototypes

- Ban guest scripts from accessing specific member names, denoted as "banned".


====================================================
From trying to typecheck the code:
====================================================

- Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, "aaa");

- Array: 
  * Array.prototype.slice.call(nodelist, 0);
  * concat, ...

- 09,11 has similar behavior to func04.js

- 10 SLOW !!!
  if (query.length > 0 || match[5].length <= id.length ||
      match[5].slice(0, id.length) !== id) { ... } 

- For cases when a dictionary is being assigned to a weak location of a
  dictionary, use the most general type for the weak location. 

- Fix type parser to accept strings as fields (hunter, pecker...).


====================================================
PENDING
====================================================

- Regular expresion support

- Support for array slice

- Higher-order functions:  
  need to restore Sub.checkArrows

- Exception throwing/handling


====================================================
NOTES
====================================================

- Example: 
  for (...) {
    a = /*: lA */ {};  
  }
  Is this location a single one?
