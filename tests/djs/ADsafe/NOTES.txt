====================================================
- ADsafety:
  1 widgets cannot load new code at runtime
  2 widgets cannot affect the DOM (outside their designated subtree)
  3 widgets cannot obtain direct references to the DOM
  4 widgets on the same page cannot communicate

- Blacklist field names:
  * "__proto__"
  * "__nodes__", "__star__": private fields

- Proto: there are several safe prototypes


====================================================
From trying to typecheck the code:

- Need to represent the document (DOM).
  document.defaultView

- Ban guest scripts from accessing specific member names, denoted as "banned".

- Higher-order functions:  
  need to restore Sub.checkArrows

- Exception throwing/handling

- Variable names all capital (e.g. ADSAFE)

- Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, "aaa");

- Scoping issue makes user have to rename variables:
  TS-Let-Bare: let __name = ...
  [__name] already in scope, so please use a different name.


- Probably going to need an "assume" statement. ADSafety recognizes runtime
  checks of the form: reject_global(this).



====================================================
NOTES

- x["f"] when used as a "boolean" condition should be typed as truthy or falsy. 


====================================================
QUESTIONS

- When can a weak location be updated?
