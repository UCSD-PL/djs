- Probably going to need an assume instructions. ADSafety recognizes runtime
  checks of the form: reject_global(this).

- ADsafety:
  1 widgets cannot load new code at runtime
  2 widgets cannot affect the DOM (outside their designated subtree)
  3 widgets cannot obtain direct references to the DOM
  4 widgets on the same page cannot communicate

- Blacklist field names:
  * "__proto__"
  * "__nodes__", "__star__": private fields

- Proto: there are several safe prototypes


====================================================
From trying to typecheck the code:

- Need to represent the document (DOM).
